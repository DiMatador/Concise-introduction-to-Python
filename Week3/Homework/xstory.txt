Radha knew she had to try one more time.
It may be futile, but then, she was so fond of school that the very thought of
not being able to go to school and learn all those wonderful things that they
teach at school, made her very sad. She pleaded with her father once again,
â€œBut father, I have been taking care of Gauri for the last two years and
going to school also. I can do all the household work as well,
whenever I am not at school."
